## Overview

### The challenge

Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, 
and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. 
It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

### User Story

    AS A coding boot camp student
    I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
    SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over
    WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and score
